      <t>
	A QR-code is used to encode text as a graphical
	image. Depending on the characters used in the text various
	encoding options for a QR-code exists, e.g. Numeric,
	Alphanumeric and Byte mode. Even in Byte mode a typical
	QR-code reader tries to interpret a byte sequence as an UTF-8
	or ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded text. Thus QR-codes cannot be used
	to encode arbitrary binary data directly. Such data has to be
	converted into an appropriate text before that text could be
	encoded as a QR-code.  Compared to already established Base64,
	Base32 and Base16 encoding schemes, that are described in
	<xref target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref>, the Base45 scheme
	described in this document offer a more compact QR-code
	encoding.
      </t>
      <t>
	One important difference from those and Base45 is the key
	table and that the padding with '=' is not required.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Conventions Used in This Document">
      <t>
	The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
	NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
	"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
	in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="Interpretation of Encoded Data">
      <t>
	Encoded data is to be interpreted as described in <xref
	target="RFC4648">RFC 4648</xref> with the exception that a
	different alphabet is selected.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section title="The Base45 Encoding">
      <t>
	A 45-character subset of US-ASCII is used; the 45 characters
	usable in a QR code in Alphanumeric mode. Base45
	encodes 2 bytes in 3 characters, compared to Base64,
	which encodes 3 bytes in 4 characters.
      </t>
      <t>
	For encoding two bytes [a, b] MUST be interpreted as a number
	n in base 256, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 16 bits so
	that the number n = (a*256) + b.
      </t>
      <t>
	This number n is converted to base 45 [c, d, e] so that n = c
	+ (d*45) + (e*45*45). Note the order of c, d an e which are
	chosen so that the left-most [c] is the least significant.
      </t>
      <t>
	The values c, d and e are then looked up in Table 1 to produce
	a three character string. The process is recersed when
	decoding.
      </t>
      <t>
	For encoding a single byte [a], it MUST be interpreted as a
	base 256 number, i.e. as an unsigned integer over 8 bit. That
	integer MUST be converted to base 45 [c d] so that a = c
	+ (45*d). The values c and d are then looked up in Table 1 to
	produce a two character string.
      </t>
      <t>
	A byte string [a b c d ... x y z] with arbitrary content and
	arbitrary length MUST be encoded as follows: From left to
	right pairs of bytes are encoded as described above. If the
	number of bytes is even, then the encoded form is a string
	with a length which is evenly divisible by 3. If the number of
	bytes is odd, then the last (rightmost) byte is encoded on two
	characters as described above.
      </t>
      <t>
	For decoding a Base45 encoded string the inverse operations
	are performed.
      </t>
      <section title="When to use Base45">
	<t>
	  If binary data is to be stored in a QR-Code one possible way
	  is to use the Alphanumeric mode that uses 11 bits for 2
	  characters as defined in section 7.3.4 in <xref
	  target="ISO18004">ISO/IEC 18004:2015</xref>. The
	  ECI mode indicator for this encoding is 0010.
	</t>
	<t>
	  If the data is to be sent via some other transport, a
	  transport encoding suitable for that transport should be
	  used instead of Base45. It is not recommended to first
	  encode data in Base45 and then encode the resulting string
	  in for example Base64 if the data is to be sent via
	  email. Instead the Base45 encoding should be removed, and
	  the data itself should be encoded in Base64.
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="The alphabet used in Base45">
	<t>
	  The Alphanumeric mode is defined to use 45 characters as specified
	  in this alphabet.

      <section title="Encoding examples">
	<t>
	  It should be noted that although the examples are all text,
	  Base45 is an encoding for binary data where each octet can
	  have any value 0-255.
	</t>
	<t>
	  Encoding example 1: The string "AB" is the byte sequence [65
	  66]. The 16 bit value is 65 * 256 + 66 = 16706. 16706 equals
	  11 + 45 * 11 + 45 * 45 * 8 so the sequence in base 45 is [11
	  11 8]. By looking up these values in the Table 1 we get the
	  encoded string "BB8".
	</t>
	<t>
	  Encoding example 2: The string "Hello!!" as ASCII is the
	  byte sequence [72 101 108 108 111 33 33]. If we look at each
	  16 bit value, it is [18533 27756 28449 33]. Note the 33 for
	  the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get
	  [[38 6 9] [36 31 13] [9 2 14] [33 0]] where the last byte is
	  represented by two.  By looking up these values in the Table
	  1 we get the encoded string "%69 VD92EX0".
	</t>
	<t>
	  Encoding example 3: The string "base-45" as ASCII is the
	  byte sequence [98 97 115 101 45 52 53]. If we look at each
	  16 bit value, it is [25185 29541 11572 53]. Note the 53 for
	  the last byte. When looking at the values modulo 45, we get
	  [[30 19 12] [21 26 14] [7 32 5] [8 1]] where the last byte
	  is represented by two.  By looking up these values in the
	  Table 1 we get the encoded string "UJCLQE7W581".
	</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Decoding examples">
	<t>
	  Decoding example 1: The string "QED8WEX0" represents, when
	  looked up in Table 1, the values [26 14 13 8 32 14 33 0]. We
	  arrange at the numbers in chunks of three, except last which
	  can be two, and get [[26 14 13] [8 32 14] [33 0]].  In base
	  45 we get [26981 29798 33] where the bytes are [[105 101]
	  [116 102] [33]].  If we look at the ascii values we get the
	  string "ietf!".

      <t>
	There are no considerations for IANA in this document.

    </section>
    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
	When implementing encoding and decoding it is important to be
	very careful so that buffer overflow or similar does not
	occur.  This of course includes the calculations for modulo 45
	and lookup in the table of characters (Table 1). A decoder
	also must be robust regarding input, including proper handling
	of any octet value 0-255, including the NUL character (ASCII
	0).
      </t>
      <t>
	It should be noted that Base64 and some other encodings pad
	the string so that the encoding starts with an aligned number
	of characters, Base45 specifically avoids padding.  Because of
	this, special care has to be taken when odd number of octets
	are to be encoded, which results not in N*3 characters, but
	(N-1)*3+2 characters in the encoded string and similarly, at
	decoding, when the number of encoded characters are not evenly
	divisible by 3.
      </t>
      <t>
	Base encodings use a specific, reduced alphabet to encode
	binary data. Non-alphabet characters could exist within
	base-encoded data, caused by data corruption or by
	design. Non-alphabet characters may be exploited as a "covert
	channel", where non-protocol data can be sent for nefarious
	purposes. Non-alphabet characters might also be sent in order
	to exploit implementation errors leading to, e.g., buffer
	overflow attacks.
      </t>
      <t>
	Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains
	characters outside the base alphabet (in Table 1) when
	interpreting base-encoded data.
      </t>
      <t>
	Even though a Base45 encoded string contains only characters
	from the alphabet in Table 1 the following case has to be
	considered: The string "FGW" represents 65535 (FFFF in base 16),
	which is a valid encoding.  The string "GGW" would represent
	65536 (10000 in base 16), which is represented by more than 16 bit.
      </t>
      <t>
	Implementations MUST reject the encoded data if it contains a
	triplet of characters which, when decoded, result in an
	unsigned integer which is greater then 65535 (ffff in base 16).
      </t>
      <t>
	It should be noted that the resulting string after encoding to
	Base45 might include non-URL-safe characters so if the URL
	including the Base45 encoded data have to be URL safe, one
	have to use %-encoding.
